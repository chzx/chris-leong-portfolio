      <h1 class="stylin">Introduction</h1>
      <p>Tech lovin' Full-Stack Developer. So much to learn, but learn I must. I’m usually more into Front End web development but it's always nice to try to do it all. With good design, an open mind, and good people, there are no boundaries to the things we can achieve.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I love the web and all the awesome things that come out of it. I’m excited to live and work in a time of huge advances in web technology. It’s easier than ever to share and collaborate with others, all because of the Internet. Striving to be the one of the best web developers out there.</p>

      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I’m from New York City - but to be more specific- Queens, and even more specific- Astoria. I love the variety of foods and cultures surrounding me, and more importantly, the easy access to doing whatever it is anyone may feel like doing. Any outdoor or indoor activity that can suddenly spring up in your thoughts can be achieved within reasonable distance in this giant metropolis of a city.<p/>
      <br/>
      <p>I can't say that I carry a New York attitude to all my projects - but a peaceful, calm, craftsman’s approach to Doing Things Right the First Time. I am not what some may think of as a stereotypical New Yorker. I’m finishing my design degree at NYU school of engineering, and will be graduating soon with a focus in Management of Technology and Innovation.</p>

      <h1>More About Me</h1>
      <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
      <p> I'd like to say that I'm a huge gamer. But in reality, I'm just the guy who buys or rents all the games just to try everything out. I end up playing most games for just 5 minutes... but I still do it because I want to keep myself in the loop with how games are progressing these days. So I can say I am very knowledgeable about the industry, but alas, I'm a fraud in terms of being a "hardcore" gamer. </p>
      <p>I'm also a huge sports fan, both as a player and as a viewer. This includes everything from basketball and handball to football, and tennis to the crazy olympic sports. I also love traveling. Experiencing new cultures and foods.... so addicting!
      <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
      <p>I'd love to one day open a studio that combines all my passions. Yup, that's right - something that incorporates sports, games, great web design and apps to go along with them, as well as the thrills of traveling. Sounds impossible... but why can't a good man with good plans turn dreams into reality? </p>
      <h2>What's your background?</h2>
      <p>I’ve only been programming since the Fall of 2014. I was in a full-time masters program in a different field and working full-time at the same time when I decided it was about time to finally make the career change I've always wanted. I took a big risk in resigning from my job and leaving school to pursue this path. I decided to go to mini full-stack programming bootcamp to get my feet wet and now I'm continuing to learn on my own. </p>
      <h2>What music have you been listening to lately? Show's you've been watching?</h2>
